<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## General Info:

This Assignment is for a Lending case study to be performed. Similar to a real world business problems, here is a Step by Step Process followed to Analyse the Data and reach to a percievable conclusion. Method used will be through EDA - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Based on the Data Analysis , Also we intend to have a deeper understanding of Risk Analysis when lending Money to different customers


## Technologies used:

For Analysis we have used the Python libraries like matplotlib, plt, seaborn, numpy.

###For RAW feed Files Hosting we have used AWS S3 URLs as below:

We Uploaded the File loan.csv to https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myawscloud.uk/loan.csv

We Uploaded the File Data_Dictionary.xlsx to https://s3.ap-sougth-1.amazonaws.com/myawscloud.uk/Data_Dictionary.xlsx

These Files are uploaded in AWS S3 directories in Online AWS Storage Account of Shasheesh Rane

For Coding we have used Jupyter notebook and the Google Collab online

#### FILES UPLOADED:
      a. Shasheesh_Rane.ipynb ---------- this contains the Analysis Steps and code written in Python Jupyter notebook.
      b. Lending_club_case_study.pdf---- this contains the Presentation and insights for the LendingClubCaseStudy.


## Acknowledgements:

We are grateful to IIIT-B and Upgrad , and our teachers Aditya B, to help us gain understanding of the assignment on 6thFeb2022 session.
